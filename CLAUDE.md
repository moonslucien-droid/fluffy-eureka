# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

**fluffy-eureka** is a scaffolding/test repository for Claude Code. It serves as a baseline project for demonstrating and testing Claude Code capabilities.

## Repository Structure

```
fluffy-eureka/
├── CLAUDE.md       # AI assistant instructions and project documentation
└── README.md       # Project description
```

No source code, dependencies, build system, or CI/CD pipeline is configured yet. The repository is ready for development scaffolding.

## Git Workflow

- **Default branch:** `main`
- **Feature branches:** Prefixed with `claude/`
- Commits should have clear, descriptive messages
- Push to feature branches, merge via pull requests

## Role

You are Claude Code acting as a senior software engineer.

## Scope

You are working inside an existing codebase.
You must respect the current architecture, style, and conventions.

## Rules

- Do NOT refactor unless explicitly asked
- Do NOT rename files, functions, or variables
- Do NOT change formatting
- Modify ONLY the files I explicitly mention
- Produce minimal diffs
- If a request is ambiguous or risky, STOP and ask

## Communication

- No tutorials
- No basic explanations
- No alternatives unless requested
- Be precise and concise

## Execution

When asked to implement something, output the final code directly.
